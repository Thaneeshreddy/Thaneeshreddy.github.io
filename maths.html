 <h1>Mathematics</h1>
 <h3>Program Description</h3>
 <p>Galileo called mathematics the language of the universe. Understanding that language opens up a wide range of rewarding careers. Whether your interests run to applied or theoretical math, at AUM you’ll get the skills and knowledge you need to put math to work in the real world. You’ll have two options to choose from: Traditional Mathematics or Mathematics Education, a joint program with the Department of Curriculum, Instruction, and Technology for students who want to teach in secondary schools. In addition, the department offers a two-year pre-engineering program for those who want to get their foundational engineering work in mathematics before transferring to an institution that offers the engineering degree.</p>
 <p><strong>You'll concentrate your studies in one of three areas:</strong></p>
 <ul>
     <li><strong>Traditional Mathematics</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Mathematics Education</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Pre-Engineering</strong></li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Points of Pride</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>The department hosts the Southern Algebra Conference in rotation with several other universities.</li>
     <li>The AUM Math and Computer Science Department has three student clubs — the Math Club, Engineering Club, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Student Chapter.&nbsp; The ACM Student Chapter has recently received funding from Student Government Association for building an arcade game system.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Put Your Degree to Work</h3>
<p><em>Note: While salaries vary depending on several factors including your level of experience, education and training, and geography and industry, here is a sampling of the future job growth and salaries in this area.</em></p>
<p>With a degree in mathematics, you’ll be able to choose from an abundance of higher-than-average paying jobs as businesses and government continue to need employees who can analyze big data. Employment growth of math occupations is expected to be higher than average — 28 percent from 2014 to 2024.&nbsp; The most recent median annual wage of $80,270 is higher than the median annual wage of all occupations.</p>
